    <p>For our midterm assignment, we researched reputed information literacy through the use of different journal articles, videos, and text from our class book. The main source for this information came from <a href="http://libraries.uky.edu/">University of Kentucky's Library</a>. We decided that each of these pieces of literature needed to meet the criteria of being accessible or found through the use of the Univerivertiy of Kentucky's Library Database, the source must contain context relating to Information Science where it could benefit and support our statements, and all source have to be reviewed through trustworthy peers or professionals. All new sources can be found on the Information Science tab. This page splits each source into the style the infromation is presented and gives a summary on how each one meets the criteria.</p>
