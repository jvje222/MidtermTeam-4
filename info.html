    <p>The article <a href="http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uky.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&sid=bdf2daad-88b2-4e37-8d1f-b415364f231e%40pdc-v-sessmgr01"><i>Evolution of Library and Information Science, 1965–2005:
Content Analysis of Journal Articles</i></a> describes the process of how people have used libraries and technology to research information sciences and what they do with that information. Research about Information Science and its past has increased with the past 20 years because of the introduction to new libraries, databases, and with the accessibility of the internet. The main purpose of this article is to give viewers information on how journal articles have been used to research Information Literacy in the past and how it has impacted the understanding of the subject. The author concluded that Information Literacy methods and research had the common goal of using Information Science to learn about the habits of researchers to accurate information effectively.</p>

    <p>The article <a href="https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/217978697/fulltextPDF/D747ED284DAE4A4BPQ/1?accountid=11836"><i>Redefining information science: from "information science" to "knowledge science"</i></a> is a good “soul searching” essay on information science at a conceptual level. The author here is making an argument for the field to rename itself to better align with the difference between data, information, and knowledge. This source meets our criteria because the full-text is available via UKY Libraries and it is Peer Reviewed. I believe this is an appropriate source because understanding the difference between data, information, and knowledge is critical to understanding the field of Information Science.
