      <h1>Journal Articles</h1>
    </header>
    <p>The article <a href="http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uky.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&sid=bdf2daad-88b2-4e37-8d1f-b415364f231e%40pdc-v-sessmgr01"><i>Evolution of Library and Information Science, 1965–2005:
Content Analysis of Journal Articles</i></a> describes the process of how people have used libraries and technology to research information sciences and what they do with that information. Research about Information Science and its past has increased with the past 20 years because of the introduction to new libraries, databases, and with the accessibility of the internet. The main purpose of this article is to give viewers information on how journal articles have been used to research Information Literacy in the past and how it has impacted the understanding of the subject. The author concluded that Information Literacy methods and research had the common goal of using Information Science to learn about the habits of researchers to accurate information effectively.</p>

    <p>The article <a href="https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/217978697/fulltextPDF/D747ED284DAE4A4BPQ/1?accountid=11836"><i>Redefining information science: from "information science" to "knowledge science"</i></a> is a good “soul searching” essay on information science at a conceptual level. The author here is making an argument for the field to rename itself to better align with the difference between data, information, and knowledge. This source meets our criteria because the full-text is available via UKY Libraries and it is Peer Reviewed. I believe this is an appropriate source because understanding the difference between data, information, and knowledge is critical to understanding the field of Information Science.

    <p>Many students today find it difficult to pick up science research literature which makes it difficult for future tasks. The article <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/doi/full/10.1080/87567555.2014.916650"><i>When Science and Information Literacy Meet: An Approach to Exploring the Sources of Science News with Non-Science Majors</i></a> tacks that idea by assigning non-science majors to enroll in science classes. This article looks at the advantages and disadvantages of knowing information literacy determining if there is a difference. Media is an important science tool of information but can be difficult with the forever changing literacy of society. It is important to develop student skills with the proper information goal. By actively searching scientific articles students are more engaged and develop skills such as information seeking, terminology, and an understanding of media reports without content training.</p>

    <h1>Videos, Podcast, and Infographics</h1>
  </header>
    <p>Information science is the pertaining and movement of information. Information science allows people and store, classify, collect, manipulate, retrieve, disseminate, and protect information. Information science is a collection of multiple disciplines that build upon each other. One thing to note is that information science is not the same as an information library. Although they may be taught in combination they operate on two different fields. Link to video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aazHhC5tYY4&feature=youtu.be">What is INFORMATION SCIENCE? What does INFORMATION SCIENCE mean?</a></p>

    <p>We chose the podcast <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/so-what-library-and-information-science-researh/e/60092468?autoplay=true">Emerging Library & Information Perspectives (ELIP)</a> because it relates to what we are currently learning about, it talks about emerging library and information science perspectives, and it talks about new perspectives regarding information science.</p>

  <img id="infographic1" src="images/IS Illustration.jpg" alt="Mark's Infographic" height="560">
  <p>This is one of the What is Information Science infographics that was created earlier in the Fall 2020 semester. While this is not available on UKY Libraries, we believe it to be pertinent as a good overview/introduction into what Information Science is for people before they dig into the more in-depth sources in the rest of the repository. </p>

    <h1>Book Chapters</h1>
  </header>
    <p>The chapter <i>Social Justice Concepts and Public Libraries: A Case Study</i> of the book <a href="https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/lib/kentucky-ebooks/reader.action?docID=4509357&ppg=42">Perspectives on Libraries As Institutions of Human Rights and Social Justice</a> dives into the relationship between public libraries and social justice ideals. This book chapter contains the article from a case study diving into this relationship. This source meets our criteria because the book’s full-text is available via UKY Libraries. I believe this is an appropriate source because, given the current state of affairs in America and the current news cycle, understanding how these fields are connected can be a huge step towards behaving professionally and ethically.</p>

    <p>The chapter <i>The Digitally Excluded Learner and Strategies for Success</i> of the book titiled <a href="https://www-igi-global-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/gateway/chapter/full-text-html/112655"> Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Third Edition</a> talks about the advantages that technology has contributed to the success of countries in the past. Since we are currently in a digital economy where we use technology every day to give us the information needed, we have become dependable on something that was not available in the past decades. Technology has allowed different countries to grow through education, wealth, and even allies. I believe that this source meets our criteria because it was a book found through the University of Kentucky Library Database, it explains how Information Sciences have benefited the world, and it comes from a trusted source of being used at different universities around the nation for learning everything about Information Science and Technology.</p>
